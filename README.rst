*If you're confused about why you can't pull a fresh version of the sudomesh fork, it's because I (maxb) 
re-wrote a bunch of history on the master branch. I apologize and it's pretty much entirely my fault, but 
it was inevitable. Go ahead and pull a clean version of this repo and it let's all cross our fingers it works!*
